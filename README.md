# ChooseYourOwnAdventureGame
This is a choose your own adventure game I made earlier in my development path. It was the final project for my Python Fundamentals course and, I think its funny, and it works for where my experience level was at that point. If I ever find the time I would love to come back and continue work on this, maybe redo the choices with a more Object Oriented approach but, I am satisfied with how it came out, For its the first thing I ever made from scratch.
